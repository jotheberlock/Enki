    <title>Enki - a hobby compiler</title>
    <body>
      <p>
	Enki is a language and compiler for a language that I've been working
	on in my spare time for quite a while now. Its syntax is mostly
	Python-inspired with a little Pascal; it's statically typed;
	it supports generators, closures and LISP-style multimethods.
      </p>
      <p>
        It compiles to native 32-bit ARM or x86-64 machine code runnable on
	Windows, MacOS, Linux and Android. Supporting (jailbroken) iOS
        and Windows Mobile as well isn't too difficult in theory.
      </p>
      <p>
	<a href="FAQ.html">FAQ</a> here and a description of
	<a href="controlflow.html">Control flow</a> here.
      </p>
      <p>For a brief indication of the language, some of the regression
	tests give a good indication -
	<a href="tests/TEST.043.generics_with_inheritance.e">generic functions</a>,
	<a href="tests/TEST.028.yield.e">activation types/generators</a> and of course good old 
        <a href="tests/TEST.036.fizzbuzz.e">FizzBuzz</a> for general syntax.</p>
      <p>
	Future plans:
	<ul>
	  <li>Support AArch64.</li>
	  <li>Possibly MIPS?</li>
	  <li>Actually have a memory manager. Add Apple ARC-style
	    reference counting for objects.</li>
	  <li>Create cross-platform object format and Windows/Linux/Mac
	    loaders for it - one compiled object format should be able to
	    work across all platforms for a given CPU architecture.</li>
          <li>GPU support? The Raspberry Pi GPU and intel GPUs are
	    documented at the instruction set level; Enki should be able to
	    target them.</li>
	  <li>Relatedly, floating point support.</li>
	  <li>Actual optimisation, especially a proper graph colouring register allocator.</li>
	 </ul>			    
      </p>
      <p>
	Some possibly-dogmatic assumptions about the architectures I'm
	interested in that I've made in the design:
	<ul>
	  <li>64 bit CPUs (not 32 bit and not 128 bit) are the way the world's
	    going to be for the next few decades at least. I support 32-bit
	    ARM as a target but e.g. in future standard library design
	    I am going to assume that virtual address space is cheap
	    and copious.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    In particular, I assume that hosts have efficient 64-bit
	    integer types (not that this stops the compiler running on a 32-bit
	    platform, of course).
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    My ISA targets a machine with a reasonable number of registers,
	    load/store addressing, 32- or 64- bits, with twos-complement
	    integer arithmetic and byte addressing. No 8087-style FPU nonsense,
	    no 8 or 16 bit microcontrollers, no weird 1970s supercomputers.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    The future is pretty much entirely ARM and x86-64. I might consider
	    PowerPC and MIPS, they still have some use in the embedded world,
	    but e.g. I'm not interested in trying to support weird legacy
	    stuff like Itanium, and other than AArch64 supporting any new
	    ISAs is not a high priority to me, nor is supporting any new
	    OSes other than perhaps jailbroken iOS and Windows/ARM (since I'm
	    working at the kernel syscall level Android and normal Linux are
	    both supported already - no glibc/Bionic dependency).
	  </li>
	</ul>
