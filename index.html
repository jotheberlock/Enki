    <title>Enki - a hobby compiler</title>
    <body>Enki is a language and compiler for a language that I've been working on in my spare time for quite a while now. Its syntax is
          mostly Python-inspired with a little Pascal; it's statically typed; it supports generators, closures and LISP-style multimethods. 
          It compiles to native 32-bit ARM or x86-64 machine code runnable on Windows, MacOS, Linux and Android. Supporting (jailbroken) iOS
          and Windows Mobile as well isn't too difficult in theory.
