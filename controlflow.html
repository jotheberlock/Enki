  <title>A simplified description of the steps the compiler takes to
    generate a binary.</title>
  <body>
  <ul>
    <li>main() reads any ini files on the command line and parses them,
      using them to construct a Config defining the target (e.g. x86-64 ELF).
      If no ini file is specified it defaults to a target that matches
      the host.</li>
    <br>
    <li>main() reads in any .e (Enki) files specified either in the ini files
      or on the command line, concatenating them into a vector of UCS-4
      codepoints.</li>
    <br>
    <li>main() constructs a Lexer and feeds it the codepoints.</li>
    <br>
    <li>main() constructs a Parser and tells it to parse the Lexer's
      output, resulting in an AST tree (also populating the symbol
      table and type database).</li>
    <br>
    <li>main() construct a Backend, hands it the AST and the Config and
      tells the Backend to process it.</li>
    <br>
    <li>The Backend creates a root Codegen representing the anonymous
      outer function where code and variables outside of an explicit def'd
      function go.</li>
    <br>
    <li>The Backend tells the root Codegen to generate code, which
      recursively calls codegen() on the various nodes of the AST; in the
      case of DefExpr's, these will create new Codegens.
      The AST codegen() methods generate intermediate code that is held in
      BasicBlocks owned by Codegens.</li>
    <br>
    <li>
      The Backend gets a list of Passes from the Config and applies
      each pass in order to each Codegen, transforming the code from the
      initially generated IR to something directly translatable to a given
      ISA.</li>
    <br>
    <li>
      The Backend gets an Image from the Config, calculates the necessary
      size for its sections and allocates them.</li>
    <br>
    <li>
      The Backend gets an Assembler from the Config and uses it to generate
      machine code into the text section of the Image. It writes the
      relevant data into the other sections - the Rtti writes out the Rtti
      section, the Mtables writes out generic function data, the Constants
      writes out constant data (i.e. string literals, at the moment).</li>
    <br>
    <li>
      The Backend tells the Image to apply its relocations for branch
      offsets and function addresses.</li>
    <br>
    <li>
      The Backend tells the Image to write out the final binary.</li>
  </ul>
