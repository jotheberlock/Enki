<title>FAQ</title>
<body>
<h3>What's the point?</h3>
<p>
  Well, primarily I'm doing this for fun and as a learning experience.
  However, there are some future aims that I haven't really seen done
  anywhere else - for instance, it should be possible to come up with
  an executable that can run on all operating systems with the same code
  (for a given CPU architecture), given a platform-specific stub loader/
  standard library provider; this is only possible since I control
  the calling convention, everything I link to, and the binary formats I output.
</p>
<h3>Why not just use LLVM?</h3>
<p>
  I'm aware of LLVM and have played around with it, but unfortunately while
  it is Low Level it is still a Virtual Machine (conceptually), and it abstracts
  away the very things I'm interested in playing about with - calling
  conventions, both in the narrow sense of e.g. __stdcall and the wide
  sense (it assumes a C-style stack whereas I want to play about with
  continuations and suchlike) and object file formats. LLVM is great if you
  want to write a C(++)-like language that can link against existing
  libraries on your platform of choice, but less well adapted for something more
  esoteric.
</p>
<h3>Haven't you heard of C++11?</h3>
<p>
  I have indeed heard of C++11, but I've more or less followed the conventions
  Qt for example followed at the time of the start of the project; like Qt, I'd
  like this to be widely and easily compilable by pretty much anything; indeed,
  I've successfully compiled it on an old SPARC box with gcc 3.4.
  So, no auto x=foo, no shared/unique_ptr, no lambdas, not even stdint.h.
</p>
<p>
  Were I to start out again I might choose C++11 by default, but then again
  I might not - being able to compile on pretty much anything is a nice
  feature, and for instance IBM's compiler for AIX still in 2017 doesn't
  have support for some fairly basic C++11 features like unique_ptr. As it is,
  any C++ compiler more recent than about Visual Studio 6 or gcc 2.7 should
  work.
</p>
<h3>Why the wacky syntax?</h3>
<p>
  Well, I know Python syntax is like Marmite, but I happen to like
  it personally and have mostly adapted it (though removing the
  technically-unnecessary : at the end of control flow statements).
  However, Python doesn't have notions of things like types or pointers
  so I had to come up with syntax for that from somewhere and something
  a bit Pascal like seemed as reasonable a choice as any.
</p>
<h3>Why is the code generated so verbose?</h3>
<p>
  I'm mostly interested in getting things to work right now rather than
  generating optimal code. In particular, at some point in the future
  I'd like to write a proper graph colouring register allocator and a proper
  stack slot allocator (allowing variables to share stack slots when they
  don't have overlapping liveness ranges) which should improve things
  quite a bit.
</p>
<h3>What is this 'generic function' business?</h3>
<p>
  Known as <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?MultiMethods">multi methods</a> in
  LISP-land, multimethods are effectively C++ virtual methods on steroids,
  in that they dispatch on all their argument types, not just the first,
  implicit one (e.g. 'this', the concrete type of the object). It seemed
  a neat idea so I added it.
</p>
<h3>What is this 'activation type' business?</h3>
<p>
  These are variables that look like e.g. Uint64$. It is is basically what is
  known in Python land as a
  <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?GeneratorsInPython">generator</a>, more or less.
  When you call a function with an activation type as an lvalue,
  a stack frame is allocated, the function is called, the return value
  is saved into the stack frame, the function returns, and the activation
  type points at the stack frame, which is not deallocated. When you use
  an activation type as an rvalue, it works like a variable of the base
  type (e.g. Uint64) and when evaluated it reads the return value out
  of the stack frame (with the exception of assignment to another
  activation variable, which just copies the pointer to the frame).
</p>
<p>
  Now, the secret sauce here is that you can <i>yield</i> instead of
  return in a function and it stores the instruction pointer at the point
  of the yield in that stack frame. With the ! operator on the activation
  type, the stack frame is re-entered and the function resumes until
  the next yield, which can change the return value stored in the stack
  frame and thus the value when the activation variable is used as an rvalue.
</p>
<h3>Why no interoperability with C code?</h3>
<p>
  Well, my ultimate aim is to be able to write platform-independent
  programs calling into my own platform-specific standard library. The
  easiest way to make this work is to control everything from the ground
  up, and on Unix in particular as soon as you drag libc in it tends
  to want to take over things like memory management, and pretty much everything
  else depends on (a particular version of) libc. Thus, I'd rather work
  at the syscall level and control it all myself, given what I'm aiming for.#
</p>
<p>
  There is basic interoperability with Windows libraries, however,
  because that is the only level Microsoft guarantees ABI stability;
  system calls literally get renumbered with every build of the operating
  system and also at least on some versions of Windows executables will
  simply crash in the loader if they don't import ntdll.dll before even hitting
  user code.
